# OpenPhonemizer

A permissively licensed, open sourced, local IPA Phonemizer (G2P) powered by deep learning. This Phonemizer attempts to replicate the `espeak` Phonemizer while remaining permissively-licensed.

## Project

* Project status: Alpha
* Supported languages: English (more coming soon!)

## Installation


```bash
pip install "openphonemizer @ git+https://github.com/NeuralVox/OpenPhonemizer"
```

## Usage

### OpenPhonemizer

```python
from openphonemizer import OpenPhonemizer
phonemizer = OpenPhonemizer()
# Or specify a custom checkpoint path: OpenPhonemizer('model.pt')
phonemizer('test')
phonemizer('hello this is a test')
```

## Evaluation

We introduce PhonemizerBench, a benchmark to evaluate the similarity of alternate Phonemizers to `espeak`.

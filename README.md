# OpenPhonemizer

**[Audio Samples](https://neuralvox.github.io/OpenPhonemizer/) / [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openphonemizer/PhonemizerHub)**

A permissively licensed, open sourced, local IPA Phonemizer (G2P) powered by deep learning. This Phonemizer attempts to replicate the `espeak` Phonemizer while remaining permissively-licensed.

OpenPhonemizer is heavily based on the amazing [DeepPhonemizer](https://github.com/as-ideas/DeepPhonemizer). The main changes are the model checkpoints, which more closely resembles `espeak`'s phonemizer.

Optional GPL-licensed portions are available [here](https://github.com/NeuralVox/OpenPhonemizer-GPL).

## Features

* Permissively licensed & open source
* Fast & efficient
* Works well with TTS models that depend on phonemizer or espeak
* Automatic GPU acceleration (CUDA/MPS) if available

## Project

* Project status: Alpha
* Supported languages: English (more coming soon! What languages do you want? Let me know!)

## Installation

Easily install OpenPhonemizer:

```bash
pip install openphonemizer
```

Or, install the latest version from Git:

```bash
pip install "openphonemizer @ git+https://github.com/NeuralVox/OpenPhonemizer"
```

## Usage

### OpenPhonemizer

```python
from openphonemizer import OpenPhonemizer
phonemizer = OpenPhonemizer()
# Or specify a custom checkpoint path: OpenPhonemizer('model.pt')
phonemizer('test')
phonemizer('hello this is a test')
```

## Evaluation

We introduce PhonemizerBench, a benchmark to evaluate the similarity of alternate Phonemizers to `espeak`.

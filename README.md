# OpenPhonemizer

**[Audio Samples](https://neuralvox.github.io/OpenPhonemizer/) / [Models](https://huggingface.co/openphonemizer/ckpt) / [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openphonemizer/PhonemizerHub) / [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mrfakename/ipa-phonemes-word-pairs)**

A permissively licensed, open sourced, local IPA Phonemizer (G2P) powered by deep learning. This Phonemizer attempts to replicate the `espeak` Phonemizer while remaining permissively-licensed.

OpenPhonemizer is heavily based on the amazing [DeepPhonemizer](https://github.com/as-ideas/DeepPhonemizer). The main changes are the model checkpoints, which more closely resembles `espeak`'s phonemizer.

Optional GPL-licensed portions are available [here](https://github.com/NeuralVox/OpenPhonemizer-GPL).

## Features

* Permissively licensed & open source
* Fast & efficient
* Works well with TTS models that depend on phonemizer or espeak
* Automatic GPU acceleration (CUDA/MPS) if available

## Project

* Project status: Alpha
* Supported languages: English (more coming soon! What languages do you want? Let me know!)

## Installation

Easily install OpenPhonemizer:

```bash
pip install -U openphonemizer
```

Or, install the latest version from Git:

```bash
pip install -U "openphonemizer @ git+https://github.com/NeuralVox/OpenPhonemizer"
```

## Usage

### OpenPhonemizer

```python
from openphonemizer import OpenPhonemizer
phonemizer = OpenPhonemizer()
# Or specify a custom checkpoint path: OpenPhonemizer('model.pt')
phonemizer('test')
phonemizer('hello this is a test')
```

Please note that by default, OpenPhonemizer loads a built-in dictionary of words/phonemes. Because storage is quite inefficient, the model is ~100MB larger and uses more memory, however it is _much_ faster. If you're low on VRAM, you can either run the model exclusively on CPU (`disable_gpu=True`) or load a model without a dictionary.

**Load without dictionary:**

```python
from cached_path import cached_path
from openphonemizer import OpenPhonemizer
phonemizer = OpenPhonemizer(str(cached_path('hf://openphonemizer/ckpt/best_model_no_optim.pt'))) # add disable_gpu=True to run on CPU only
phonemizer('test')
phonemizer('hello this is a test')
```

**[NEW] Use autoregressive model:**

NEW: An autoregressive model is now available. The autoregressive model is more accurate but slightly slower. To use the autoregressive model:

```python
OpenPhonemizer(str(cached_path('hf://openphonemizer/autoreg-ckpt/best_model.pt')))
```

## Evaluation

We introduce PhonemizerBench, a benchmark to evaluate the similarity of alternate Phonemizers to `espeak` (this benchmark measures against `espeak`, assuming it's score is 100).

**Run 1**

| Phonemizer | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Gruut | 75.08 |
| DeepPhonemizer | 85.24 |
| G2P_EN | 86.16 |
| OpenPhonemizer | 93.64 |
| OpenPhonemizer Autoregressive | **93.74** |

**Run 2**

| Phonemizer | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Gruut | 75.54 |
| DeepPhonemizer | 85.03 |
| G2P_EN | 86.28 |
| OpenPhonemizer | 93.54 |
| OpenPhonemizer Autoregressive | **93.59** |

**Run 3**

| Phonemizer | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Gruut | 73.72 |
| DeepPhonemizer | 84.64 |
| G2P_EN | 85.74 |
| OpenPhonemizer | 93.38 |
| OpenPhonemizer Autoregressive | **93.67** |

## Todo
